# conditional statements can be used 


# example 
count=10
if [ $count -eq 10 ]                     # if condition 
then 
    echo "the condition is true "
elif [ $count <= 9 ]                    # elif conditon 
then 
    echo "the count is 9 in given condition "

else                                    # else condtion
    echo " the condition is false "

:'  here we can use   iqal to  is   -eq
                      not iqal to is  -nq
                      greater then   -gt  or u can use > ny using paranthasis  [ $count -gt 10 ] (( $count > 10 )) 
                      for less then you can use u can use < ny using paranthasis  [ $count -lt 10 ] (( $count < 10 )) 
                      for and operator  can be used in   $$  or -a
                      for or operator we can use  -o   or || '
